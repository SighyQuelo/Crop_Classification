# Machine Learning for automated crop classification from satellite imagery in Precision Agriculture
This repository (https://github.com/SighyQuelo/Crop_Classification) countains the code developped for the Individual Project of the Electronic and Electrical Engineering departement of the University of Strathclyde

## Project description
Precision agriculture relies on accurate crop classification to optimize resource utilization and enhance agricultural productivity. In this project, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were investigated as machine learning algorithms to develop reliable tools for automated crop identification. The project provides insights into parameter-tuning strategies to enhance the classification performance of both algorithms.

## Code Organisation
Two python notebooks are available :
* Dataset_creation.ipynb : This file contains all the functions and codes to process and create the dataset as well as two tests for features and image visualisation
* Models.ipynb : This file contains the methods, class and function used to create, tune, train and assess the models

## Dataset
Please Refer to Dr Javier Cardona to get the dataset used
